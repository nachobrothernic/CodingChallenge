# Hello!

This is my submission for a coding challenge, I imagine it will be requested I either take it down or make it private following evaluation as to not let anyone potentially cheat off of me.

# Setup

`npm init -D`

# Compiling to run my basic test in index.ts

`npm start`

# Running Jest Tests

`npm test`
